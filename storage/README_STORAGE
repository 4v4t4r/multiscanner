This document will outline the design of the multiscanner
storage framework.

The underpinning of the storage will be a sqlite database.
The sqlite database will have several duties.

The sqlite DB will track 3 things: task_id, task status, and
report id. Task ID will be a unique ID generate automatically
by SQLite. 

Task status will be either pending, running, or completed.
When a task is completed, the multiscanner will insert the
report into the storage framework, and update the
sqlite entry to have task_status be completed and populate
the report ID with the value returned from the storage
subframework.
